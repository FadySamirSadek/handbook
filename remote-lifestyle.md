## X-Outposts {#outposts}

Who doesn't like working from home or, indeed, anywhere on the planet? Silly question, right? That's why we here at X-Team positively adore our X-Outposts.

### What is the X-Outpost?

The X-Outpost is a roaming hacker house where nomad developers live, work and explore together. Each month, the X-Outpost moves to a different city in the world. They are hosted by Guardians, someone who serves as the host and guide for all activities.

### How does it work?

Every outpost lasts about a month and can be visited at any point. Weekdays are dedicated to remote working and light exploration, while weekends are for activities \(including one EPIC activity\).

We traveled and worked, and compromised neither of the two. This is what X-Outpost was, and I’d repeat it all over again in a heartbeat.”
