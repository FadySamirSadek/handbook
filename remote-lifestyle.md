## X-Outposts {#outposts}

Who doesn't like working from home or, indeed, anywhere on the planet? Silly question, right? That's why we here at X-Team  created the X-Outpost.

### What is the X-Outpost?

The [**X-Outpost**](http://x-team.com/x-outpost) is a roaming hacker house where nomad developers live, work and explore together. Each month, the X-Outpost moves to a different city in the world. They are hosted by Guardians, someone who serves as the host and guide for all activities.

### How does it work?

Every Outpost lasts about a month and can be visited at any point. Weekdays are dedicated to remote working and light exploration, while weekends are for activities \(including one EPIC activity\).

X-Team sponsors the cost of the accommodation, you just have to get yourself there.

### Past Experiences {#outposts-past}

We've already had years worth of X-Outposts, and you can check out some of the diaries of past Xplorers:



[X-OUTPOST: POLAND DIARY](https://x-team.com/blog/x-outpost-poland-diary/)

Drifting cars, flying drones, surviving a storm, visiting the largest castle in the world, endless steak, and so much more.



[MEMOIRS FROM ITALY](https://x-team.com/blog/memoirs-x-outpost/)

We traveled and worked, and compromised neither of the two. This is what X-Outpost was, and I’d repeat it all over again in a heartbeat.”



[2016 X-OUTPOST RECAP](https://x-team.com/blog/x-outpost-2016-recap/)

In 2016, the X-Outpost was hosted in 4 countries and 5 cities, including: Gran Canaria, Naples, Boston, Chicago, and Koh Phangan.
