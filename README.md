# Introduction

Oh hi there! Welcome to the illustrious group that is X-Team! You have finally passed all the hurdles and been introduced on \#xhq. You have had your first onboarding chat, and you are eagerly awaiting the beginning of your first project. Or perhaps, all of this is far behind you and you're just reading this because you want to remain current on how things work, with all these changes and what not.

Fear not, in both cases, this guide will get you up to speed with what you absolutely must know, what you should know, and what's simply good to know, especially as you embark on adventures throughout the world as a location-independent digital nomad.

The guide is written so that you can jump in anywhere — don't feel like you have to read it from the beginning to the end. And now, pick where you want to continue and enjoy your stay! And if you don't know where to stay, there's a [yuuuuge list of channels](https://x-team.com/missions/slack/) available — it's the best, just the greatest ;\)
