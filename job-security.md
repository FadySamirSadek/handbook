# Job Security

In X-Team, we're all contractors. If this is the first time you're not working as a regular employee with all the legal protections that status affords you, you may be feeling a bit anxious about the lack of job security you have working as a contractor.

But do not fear. As in many other areas, you'll find that we've got your back as much as we can.

So here's the answer to this doubt, which will, hopefully, put your mind at ease.

## What happens when my engagement comes to an end? Am I out of work?

Three scenarios can happen when a project comes to an end:

1. We'll line up another opportunity for you to move on to after your current project ends. This is actually the most common scenario and what we'll be aiming for once you join our community.

1. So long as you've committed to learning and growing and have kept your skills current throughout your time in X-Team, we will continue investing in you and keep you on board for up to 3 months until we have a new opportunity for you. You will also meet with @paul.mccrodden, who’ll set you up with a growth strategy which you’ll work on during that time to put you in a better position with prospective projects and boost your chances of landing a new project with our partners as soon as possible.

1. Sometimes, if rarely, negative outcomes do happen. If your skillset no longer aligns with what companies are looking for on their teams, we'll part ways until we're able to offer you a new opportunity that aligns well with your experience. This isn't as common in X-Team, as we work hard to motivate you to always be learning and growing so that your skills will always remain marketable.
