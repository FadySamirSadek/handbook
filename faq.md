* **I read the whole guide front to back and back to front, including this FAQ, and I still don't understand X!**  
  Talk to [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6). Either he has the answer or he'll get it for you.

* **I'm waiting for the meeting with my Account Manager (Jake, Luke, Brad) and the partner team. What am I supposed to do meanwhile?**  
  Relax, have a look around slack, join [channels that attract your attention](https://x-team.com/missions/slack/), have a chat with your fellow X-Teamers and enjoy. You will get the project-specific onboarding at the meeting with your account manager and the partner team at the meeting which you've probably already been invited to â€” if you haven't, talk to your account manager (usually Jake, Luke, or Brad).
